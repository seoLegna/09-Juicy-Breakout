Our juicy Breakout game

Hey, particles are so cool!
I loved working on this exercise,
playing with some new things, 
using some new nodes.

I think I did a 'ok' job with this game,
it could have been so much better.

The camera movement is intentional and so is the 
hike in difficulty due to it (the camera moves thus dis aligning the cursor and the paddle.).

Thank you.
